YES! I NEED THIS REWARD!

P.S. If you're wondering how we put a price on a Shahadah, here's how!

We calculate how many people accept Islam then divide it by how much money we spent on food, transport, time, people going out there and giving Dawah

£100 for 3 Shahahs is the minimum!

iERA is a registered U.K. charity (1134566)

I don't get paid for this, it is simply my passion and an honour for me!

Support the Dawah!
